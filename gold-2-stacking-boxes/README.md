# Stacking Boxes - Gold 2 Achievement
A simple 3D stacking game based on physics, impemented in godot v4.4.

## Features
- Movement: Use the mouse to move stackable objects.
- Dropping Objects: Left-click to drop a stackable object.
- Randomized Stackables: A new random stackable appears one second after the previous one is dropped.
- Game Over: The game ends if a stackable falls outside the box.
- Restart Option: Click the restart button to start over.
- Dynamic Camera: The camera adjusts automatically based on the stack height.

The following code was generated by ChatGPT and modified to fit the project's needs:
```gdcscript
func handle_edge_scrolling(mouse_pos: Vector2, screen_size: Vector2, delta: float) -> void:
	var scroll_vec = Vector2.ZERO
	
	# Check if mouse is near screen edges
	if mouse_pos.x < edge_threshold:
		scroll_vec.x = -1.0 * (1.0 - (mouse_pos.x / edge_threshold))
	elif mouse_pos.x > screen_size.x - edge_threshold:
		scroll_vec.x = 1.0 * (1.0 - ((screen_size.x - mouse_pos.x) / edge_threshold))
		
	if mouse_pos.y < edge_threshold:
		scroll_vec.y = -1.0 * (1.0 - (mouse_pos.y / edge_threshold))
	elif mouse_pos.y > screen_size.y - edge_threshold:
		scroll_vec.y = 1.0 * (1.0 - ((screen_size.y - mouse_pos.y) / edge_threshold))
	
	# Apply scrolling
	camera_offset.x += scroll_vec.x * edge_scroll_speed * delta
	camera_offset.z += scroll_vec.y * edge_scroll_speed * delta
	
	# Limit movement
	camera_offset.x = clamp(camera_offset.x, -max_camera_distance, max_camera_distance)
	camera_offset.z = clamp(camera_offset.z, -max_camera_distance, max_camera_distance)
